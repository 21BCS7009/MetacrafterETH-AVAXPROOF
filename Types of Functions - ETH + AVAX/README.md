# DegenToken Project

DegenToken is an ERC20 token contract deployed on the Avalanche network. It provides a basic implementation of an ERC20 token with additional functionality for minting, transferring, redeeming, and burning tokens.

## Features

- Minting new tokens: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens and distribute them to specific accounts.
- Transferring tokens: Token holders can transfer their tokens to other addresses.
- Redeeming tokens: Token holders can burn their tokens to redeem them for in-game store items.
- Burning tokens: Anyone can burn their own tokens that are no longer needed.
- Balance inquiry: Token holders can check their token balance at any time.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
    npm Install

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract on the Avalanche network using a development environment or deployment tool of your choice.

2. Interact with the contract through your preferred method, such as a DApp, a web interface, or a command-line interface.

3. Utilize the contract functions to mint new tokens, transfer tokens, redeem tokens, burn tokens, and check token balances.
